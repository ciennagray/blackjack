### Requirements:
- Setting up a React project. You are welcome to use create-react-app.
- Show us judgment in how you structure and decompose your code. Remember to optimize as much readability as well as performance. Good abstractions and indirections = extensibility without over-engineering.
- Show us good understanding of React fundamentals and best practices
- Interacting with the API at http://deckofcardsapi.com/
- A reasonable implementation of a basic Blackjack game according to the above rules
- Cards played should be displayed with their respective images (the API provides image urls)
- There should be a simple display of “You Win” or “You Lose” when the round has ended

### Bonus points:
- Tests! We’ve provided plenty of rules to follow, which may be a good fit for your test cases
- Styling, but only if you have time and you would like to!
- Speed - we don’t want you to rush your implementation, and we don’t expect you to get around to every single little detail. But the time constraint will show us what you choose to focus on when you need to get scrappy
